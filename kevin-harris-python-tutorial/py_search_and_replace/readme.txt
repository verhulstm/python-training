I've written the search_and_replace sample two different ways. The Python file 
named “sr.py” is setup to run like a command-line utility while the file named, 
"search_and_replace.py" is setup to run when you double click it. 

Either way, they basically do the same thing – perform search-and-replace on 
a given file.

I’ve included a simple test file named, “test.txt”, which contains the 
following three lines for you to play with.


I love cats.
Every one should own a cat!
My neighbor has a cat.


I suggest you start off by replacing all instances of the word “cat” with your 
preferred pet. Of course, if you happen to like cats, try replacing “cat” with 
something like, “kitty”.
